# Configure multi-port services

<Warning>
Multi-port services are part of a beta release. This documentation supports testing and development scenarios. Do not use multi-port services or the v2 catalog API in secure production environments.
</Warning>

This page describes the process for integrating a service that uses multiple ports in a single container when running Consul on Kubernetes deployments. It included example configurations for an end-to-end deployment test.

## Prerequisites

Registering multi-port services with Consul has the following prerequisites:

- `consul` v1.17.0
- `consul-k8s` v1.1.0 or Consul Helm chart release v1.1.0

Configuring multi-port services for service discovery does not have additional prerequisites.

Consul’s transparent proxy for service mesh, which enables Kube DNS instead of Consul DNS through permissive mTLS settings, has additional prerequisites. For more information about the steps to configure global settings and enable permissive mTLS mode before registering a service, refer to the [onboard services in transparent mode workflow](/consul/docs/k8s/connect/onboarding-tproxy-mode#workflow).

## Enable the v2 catalog

To enable the v2 catalog and its support for multi-port services, set `global.experiments: ["resource-apis"]`. The following example configuration shows this parameter in the Helm chart’s context:

<CodeBlockConfig name="values.yaml">

```yaml
global:
  experiments: ["resource-apis"]
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

Then apply the updates to your Kubernetes cluster using either the `consul-k8s` CLI or Helm.

```shell-session
$ helm install consul hashicorp/consul --create-namespace --namespace consul --values values.yaml
```

## Define the multi-port service

To deploy a multi-port service that uses a single Envoy proxy in a single pod, you must define two Kubernetes service accounts, two Kubernetes services with their target ports, and a single Kubernetes deployment that configures two service containers and the ports they listen on.

The following example configures two pods. The first pod contains two services, `api` and `api-admin`, deployed in separate containers. This pod has a single Envoy proxy that listens on ports 80 and 90 and then forwards traffic to the appropriate container and port. The second pod defines a `web` service that functions as a static client you can use to verify that the multi-port service functions correctly.

          args: ['while true; do sleep 30; done;']

To apply these services to your Kubernetes deployment and register them with Consul, run the following command:

```shell-session
$ kubectl apply -f api.yaml -f web.yaml
```

## Configure traffic permissions

Consul uses traffic permissions to validate communication between services based on L4 identity. In the beta release of the v2 catalog API, traffic permissions allow all services by default. In order to verify that services function correctly on each port, create CRDs that deny traffic to each port.

The following examples create Consul CRDs that allow traffic to only one port of the multi-port service. Each resource separately denies `web` permission when it is a source of traffic to one of the services.

apiVersion: auth.consul.hashicorp.com/v2beta1
kind: TrafficPermissions

  name: web-to-api-admin-port-allow

  destination:
    identityName: api
  action: deny
  permissions:
    - sources:
        - identityName: web
      destinationRules:
        - portNames: ["api"]
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

    - sources:
        - identityName: web
      destinationRules:
        - portNames: ["admin"] 
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

## Validate multi-port connection

To open a shell to the `web` container, you need the name of the pod it currently runs on. Run the following command to return a list of pods:

```shell-session
$ kubectl get pods
```

### Validate both ports

Use the pod name to open a shell session and test the `api` service.

```shell-session
$ kubectl exec -it <pod-name> -c web -- curl api:80
hello world
```

Then test the `api-admin` service.

```shell-session
$ kubectl exec -it <pod-name> -c web -- curl api-admin:90
hello world from 9090 admin
```

### Validate port 80

Apply the CRD to allow traffic to port 80 only:

```shell-session
$ kubectl apply -f allow-80.yaml
```

Then, open a shell session in the `web` container and test the `api` service on port 80.

```shell-session
$ kubectl exec -it <pod-name> -c web -- curl api:80
hello world
```

Test the `admin` service on port 90. This command should fail, indicating that the traffic permission is in effect.

```shell-session
$ kubectl exec -it <pod-name> -c web -- curl api-admin:90
```

Remove the CRD before testing the other port.

```shell-session
$ kubectl delete -f allow-80.yaml
```

### Validate port 90

Apply the CRD to allow traffic to port 90 only:

```shell-session
$ kubectl apply -f allow-90.yaml
```

Then, open a shell session in the `web` container and test the `admin` service on port 90.

```shell-session
$ kubectl exec -it <pod-name> -c web -- curl api-admin:90
hello world
```

Test the `api` service on port 80. This command should fail, indicating that the traffic permission is in effect.

```shell-session
$ kubectl exec -it <pod-name> -c web -- curl api:80
```
